This project is a web game created using React, Vite, TypeScript and consuming the public API of GitHub. The game displays all the data of two randomly selected repositories and the user must choose which one has more stars. The design is made with CSS3 modules and custom hooks, and a dedicated client is used to utilize the GitHub API.
